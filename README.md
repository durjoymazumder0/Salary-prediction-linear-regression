My first linear regression model for salary prediction 
# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📊 Project Overview
My first machine learning project implementing Linear Regression to predict salaries based on years of experience.

## 🎯 Objective
Predict employee salary using years of experience as the primary feature.

## 📈 Results
- **R² Score**: 95.2%
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Dataset**: 30 samples of salary vs experience data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation
- **scikit-learn** - Machine learning
- **matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **numpy** - Numerical computations
